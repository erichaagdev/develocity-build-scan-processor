      Returns a list of builds with the common attributes of a Build Scan.
      The returned list is capped by the `maxBuilds` and `maxWaitSecs` query parameters.
      This endpoint supports pagination by using the `fromBuild` or `sinceBuild` query parameters, and the last returned build from a previous call to one of these endpoints.
    parameters:
      - in: query

                **This parameter is deprecated, use `fromInstant` instead.**
                A unix-epoch-time in milliseconds allowing to retrieve builds for which Gradle Enterprise completed receiving and processing the build after this instant.
                This parameter can only be used with `reverse=false`.
                Therefore, a value of `0` will process all builds.
                If not provided, the time in milliseconds when the request is received by the Gradle Enterprise instance will be used.
                This parameter has no effect if any of `sinceBuild`, `fromInstant`, `fromBuild` are used.
              deprecated: true
            sinceBuild:

              description: |
                **This parameter is deprecated, use `fromBuild` instead.**
                A Build Scan ID allowing to retrieve builds for which Gradle Enterprise completed receiving and processing after the given Build Scan ID (excluding it).
                This parameter can only be used with `reverse=false`.
                This parameter has precedence over any value set for the `since` parameter.
                A valid Build Scan ID must be provided, that is, a Build Scan ID that exists in the Gradle Enterprise instance.
                A Build Scan ID for a deleted build is valid.
                This parameter has no effect if any of `fromInstant`, `fromBuild` are used.
              deprecated: true
            fromInstant:

              description: |
                A unix-epoch-time in milliseconds allowing to retrieve builds for which Gradle Enterprise completed receiving and processing the build after this instant when used in conjunction with `reverse=false`, or before this instant when used in conjunction with `reverse=true`.
                Therefore, a value of `0` will process all builds.
                If not provided, the time in milliseconds when the request is received by the Gradle Enterprise instance will be used.
                This parameter has no effect if `fromBuild` is used.
            fromBuild:
              type: string
              nullable: true
              description: |

                This parameter has precedence over any value set for the `since`, `sinceBuild`, `fromInstant` parameters.
                A valid Build Scan ID must be provided, that is, a Build Scan ID that exists in the Gradle Enterprise instance.
                A Build Scan ID for a deleted build is valid.
            reverse:
              type: boolean
              nullable: true
              description: |
                A boolean indicating the time direction of the query.
                A value of `true` indicates a backward query, and returned builds will be sorted from most to least recent.
                A value of `false` indicates a forward query, and returned builds will be sorted from least to most recent.
                This parameter has no effect if any of `since`, `sinceBuild` are used.
                If not provided, the default value is `false`.
            maxBuilds:
              type: integer
              minimum: 0
              maximum: 1000
              nullable: true
              description: |
                The maximum number of builds returned by the query.
                The query returns when that number is reached or when `maxWaitSecs` is reached.
                If not provided, the default value is `100`.
            maxWaitSecs:
              type: integer
              minimum: 1
              maximum: 20
              nullable: true
              description: |
                The maximum number of seconds to wait for builds before returning.
                If this time is reached before `maxBuilds` is reached, the query returns with the already processed builds.
                Note that this time is respected with best effort.
                A query will return soon after this time has passed but there is no guarantee that it exactly returns before this time has passed.
                This parameter has no effect if `reverse=true` is specified, because new builds cannot become available in the past.
                If not provided, the default value is `3`.

            The category of the non-cacheability reason:
              * `build_cache_not_enabled` - Caching has not been enabled for the build
              * `cache-if_condition_not_matched` - Caching was disabled for the task via `org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskOutputs#cacheIf`
              * `disabled_to_ensure_correctness` - The task failed validation. Available since Gradle 7.0
              * `do-not-cache-if_condition_matched` - Caching was disabled for the task via `org.gradle.api.tasks.TaskOutputs#doNotCacheIf`
              * `multiple_outputs_declared` - The task declared multiple outputs
              * `no_outputs_declared` - The task had no outputs declared
              * `non_cacheable_inputs` - One of the task inputs was not cacheable, either because some type used as an input to the task was loaded via a custom classloader, or a Java lambda was used as an input. Available since Gradle 5.0 and before Gradle 7.5
              * `non_cacheable_task_action` - One of the task actions was not cacheable, either because it was loaded via a custom classloader, or a Java lambda was used to implement it. Available since Gradle 5.0 and before Gradle 7.5
              * `non_cacheable_task_implementation` - The task implementation was not cacheable, either because it was loaded via a custom classloader, or a Java lambda was used to implement it. Available since Gradle 5.0 and before Gradle 7.5
              * `non_cacheable_tree_output` - The task had a `org.gradle.api.file.FileTree` or a `org.gradle.api.internal.file.collections.DirectoryFileTree` as an output. Available since Gradle 5.0
              * `overlapping_outputs` - The tasks outputs overlapped with another task. As Gradle cannot safely determine which task each output file belongs to, it disabled caching            
              * `task_has_no_actions` - The task did not declare any actions
              * `task_output_caching_not_enabled` - Caching has not been enabled for the task
              * `unknown` - Reason for disabled caching was not known
